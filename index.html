      <h1>this will be a pain to moderate</h1>
      <p>if you take one look at facebook you will see just how unmoderated it is, how do we know meta will do different
        here? this will also mean federated instances with threads will have to deal with a lot of the moderation</p>

      <h1>harassment of minorities</h1>
      <p>so if you have been on facebook for even like 10 seconds you will know just how bigoted the users can be, and
        facebook does nothing
        can we really trust meta to do the same with threads?</p>

      <h1>this will cause less people to use fedi</h1>
      <p>yes i know it seems ironic, but hear me out, this will cause less people to use fedi because "oh hey heres a
        simpler app by a "trusted" platform! i should use that instead even though it has all the issues mentioned
        above"</p>

      <h1>what you can do</h1>
      <p>we cant stop facebook from federating but we can stop federating with it. if you dont want to
        have threads content on your instance, ask your admin to stop federation. this is the first time a
        large corporation is joining the fediverse (<a
          href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/21/tumblr-to-add-support-for-activitypub-the-social-protocol-powering-mastodon-and-other-apps/">beating
          tumblr to the punch</a>)
        and facebook is providing a free interface to the platform making switching to fedi easier.
        take advantage of the situation, and the fediverse will make it out untouched.</p>
